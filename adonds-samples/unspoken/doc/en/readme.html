<h2>description</h2>
<p>Unspoken deletes the <strong>name label  of objects</strong>. Different sounds are played instead of these names.<br />
Example: "more button", active Unspoken: "more (a unique sound)"<br />
This add-on can help you use your computer dynamic/faster.</p>
<h2>FEATURES:</h2>
<ul>
<li>(default) <strong>ctrl+shift+u</strong>: Activates / deactivates Unspoken. You can use profiles to disable Unspoken in some applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>(See: NVDA Menu&gt;Input gestures...&gt;Unspoken&gt;... and NVDA Menu&gt;Configuration profiles...)<br />
You can assign a different key here And you can create profiles for apps.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: this is a new feature. Testing on more machines may be required. Please consider creating Issue. ( added Date: 31 Aug 2020)</p>
<h2>A few very important note!</h2>
<p><strong>I am not the main developer of the addon.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>This add-on was running before the 2019.3 releases of NVDA.<br />
Developer was not developing the addon.</p>
<p>Afterwards, a Sudanese friend named Musharraf Omer built a new add-on by building the Audiothemes addon on Unspoken.<br />
Audiothemes have several problems.<br />
For example, some sounds crack.</p>
<p>Most of Unspoken is written in C.<br />
So it works faster and more stable against pure Python code.<br />
Audiothemes react relatively slowly.</p>
